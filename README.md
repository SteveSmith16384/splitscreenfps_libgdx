This codebase contains various game modes that all use the same framework.  When the game starts, you will begin in the "overworld".  To start a particular game mode, walk into the area that denotes that mode. 

Currently, the following games are at various stages of progress:
* 3D Monster maze: escape from the maze.  Status Complete
* Alien Tag: Don't be the player who's been tagged the longest.  Status: Complete
* Tower Defence: Build turrets to shoot the aliens.  Status: Can walk around and place turrets.
* Stock car: Race around a track.  Status: You can drive
* Deathchase: Crash into other players.  Status: You can drive around a track.
* Funny Farm: Grow and harvest crops.  Status: You can walk around an empty field
* FTL: An FTL-inspsired 3D game.  Status: You can walk around a spaceship 
* Dungeon: A 3D Roguelike.  Status: You can walk around a basic procedurally-generated dungeon.
* Bladerunner: Identify and kill the replicant.  Status: Barely started


## Controls
* Press Space at the start to use keyboard/mouse, or press X on your controller to use that.
* Esc to exit back to the overworld, or to quit out.

It depends on the specific game selected, but controls are typically:-

* W, A S, D, Space and Enter for keyboard & mouse player.  H for Help (where implemented).
* Tested with PS4 controllers.
* F1 - Toggle full Screen
* F2 - Toggle full screen but still windowed (required if you want to record the screen using Windows)


## Notes for other Developers
* Development branch is the cutting edge but possibly broken branch.  Master is the most stable but out of date.
* Gradle is a real pain to work with.  However, if you have trouble loading this project, I used Gradle v4.10.3.
* The file Settings.java contains various settings that determine what game mode the game starts in.
